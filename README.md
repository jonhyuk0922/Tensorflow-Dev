# Tensorflow-Dev
Study and Review  for Tensorflow Developer Certificate (coursera , DeeplearningAI)

<h2>Course1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning </h2>

Week1. Artifical Intelligence , Machine Learning , Deep Learning : (new paradigm) use Data , not Rule 

Week2. basic DNN(Deep Neural Networks) : avoid overfitting by using callback

Week3. basic CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks) : use Convolution layer with Pooling layer. 
- Conv layer : extract features by using n by n filter 
- Pooling layer : Compression of pixel by using 2 by 2 filter

Week4. human - horse ImageDataGenerator : 
- (prepro) Save images separated by directory and 
- (fit) use RMSprop optimizer to control the learning rate
- (Run) upload photos and it will be classificated.(just 2 answer , human or horse)


<h2>Course2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow </h2>

week1.Data validation : It categorizes numerous images by directory.

Week2. Augmentation : A technique to avoid overfitting , and we can join a <div src="https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/">kaggle competition(dogs vs cats)</div>
